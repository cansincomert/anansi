<p>
anansi is a fully featured content vectorization system aimed at providing the latest
advances in embedding generation, in-domain tuning and vector storage in an easy to use package.
</p>

### Core Features
#### üèéÔ∏è Performance
* Rust implementation of [FreshDiskANN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09613) with support for scalar quantization
* Configurable RocksDB based storage engine
* ONNX runtime support for CUDA accelerated embedding models

#### üóíÔ∏è Developer Experience
* Build indices on unstructured data without worrying about whether or not it is text, image or video
* Support for gRPC and HTTP clients
* Single installation binary that can cross-compile to non-Linux targets

#### üí° Machine Learning
* Utilize cutting-edge embeddings models that are listed on the [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)
* Bin-pack model inference on the CPU or GPU, supporting request batching with little effort
* Fine tune embedding generation with in-domain samples

### Getting Started

```bash
docker pull infrawhispers/anansi:latest
docker run --name anansi -it -p 50051:50051 -p 50052:50052 -v /.cache:/app/.cache infrawhispers/anansi:latest
```

[1] standalone embedding generation using [INSTRUCTOR](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding)
```bash
curl \
-X POST http://172.17.0.1:50052/encode \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "batches":[{
        "model_name":"INSTRUCTOR_LARGE",
        "model_class":"ModelClass_INSTRUCTOR",
        "text":{
            "data": [
                {
                    "instruction": "Represent the Science title:",
                    "value": "3D ActionSLAM: wearable person tracking ..."
                },
                {
                    "instruction": "Represent the Nature title:",
                    "value": "Inside Gohar World and the Fine, Fantastical Art"
                }
            ]
        }
    }]}
